                Apple’s Privacy Policy describes how Apple collects, uses, and shares your personal
                data.

                What Is Personal Data at Apple?
            </h5>
            <p class="text-center pt-2 text-darkGrayishBlue md:text-left">
                At Apple, we believe strongly in fundamental privacy rights — and that those
                fundamental rights should not differ depending on where you live in the world.
                That’s why we treat any data that relates to an identified or identifiable
                individual or that is linked or linkable to them by Apple as “personal data,” no
                matter where the individual lives. This means that data that directly identifies you
                — such as your name — is personal data, and also data that does not directly
                identify you, but that can reasonably be used to identify you — such as the serial
                number of your device — is personal data. Aggregated data is considered non-personal
                data for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p class="text-center pt-2 text-darkGrayishBlue md:text-left">
                This Privacy Policy covers how Apple or an Apple-affiliated company (collectively,
                “Apple”) handles personal data whether you interact with us on our websites, through
                Apple apps (such as Apple Music or Wallet), or in person (including by phone or when
                visiting our retail stores). Apple may also link to third parties on our services or
                make third-party apps available for download in our App Store. Apple’s Privacy
                Policy does not apply to how third parties define personal data or how they use it.
                We encourage you to read their privacy policies and know your privacy rights before
                interacting with them.
            </p>

            <p class="text-center pt-2 text-darkGrayishBlue md:text-left">
                At Apple, we respect your ability to know, access, correct, transfer, restrict the
                processing of, and delete your personal data. We have provided these rights to our
                global customer base and if you choose to exercise these privacy rights, you have
                the right not to be treated in a discriminatory way nor to receive a lesser degree
                of service from Apple. Where you are requested to consent to the processing of your
                personal data by Apple, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
            </p>
            <p class="text-center pt-2 text-darkGrayishBlue md:text-left">
                To exercise your privacy rights and choices including where a third-party service
                provider is acting on Apple’s behalf, visit the Apple Data and Privacy page at
                privacy.apple.com for Apple or shazam.com/privacy for Shazam. To help protect the
                security of your personal data, you must sign in to your account and your identity
                will be verified. If you want to obtain a copy of personal data that is not
                currently available from privacy.apple.com, you can make a request at
                apple.com/legal/privacy/contact.

                There may be situations where we cannot grant your request — for example, if you ask
                us to delete your transaction data and Apple is legally obligated to keep a record
                of that transaction to comply with law. We may also decline to grant a request where
                doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for antifraud and security
                purposes, such as when you request deletion of an account that is being investigated
                for security concerns. Other reasons your privacy request may be denied are if it
                jeopardizes the privacy of others, is frivolous or vexatious, or would be extremely
                impractical.
